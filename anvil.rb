    # against bin/, but zerobrew's shim resolves them against the build
    # directory (deleted after install), leaving a dangling symlink.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Anvil needs a persistent disk for containerd state. It will be created
      automatically on the first service start in ~/.anvil-vz/containerd-disk.img.

      Start the service with:
        brew services start anvil

      Or manually (required under zerobrew, which has no services support):
        #{opt_prefix}/share/anvil/scripts/anvil-service.sh start

      Switch Docker context to anvil:
        docker context use anvil
    EOS
  end

  test do
    system "#{bin}/vz-runner", "--help"
  end
end
